				Step 0: write a loop to print out each letter of our hidden word one line at a time. 
				Step 1: for each of our hiddenWord, ask if it matches our letter. Note that if I have one variable
				called testLetter1 and another variable called testLetter2, the syntax to see if they are the same is testLetter1.equals(testLetter2); 						also use println("yes at index" + i) when it matches and check to see if the value of i is what you expect
				Step 2: now when a guess is correct, also update our guessedWord (which starts with all dashes) to have the correctly guessed letter
					in the right place. To test this, print out the guessedWord. 
				Step 3: You have the key element of hangman down! Now write code that lets the user know when they guessed incorrectly. Make sure that 
					the rest of the program still works even if there is more then one of the same letter!
				Step 4(extra): write code to test if we're done with the game
				Step 5(extra): move the code you wrote in Step 5 into a brand new function, and call the function.
